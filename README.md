# Data_Engineering_Node_Js_MySQL_Docker_application

## Goal :
- Deploy a nodejs application connected to a deployed mysql database

## Author :
- Florian Marques

## Use the project
- Use `docker compose up` to build and deploy the docker
- If at the first `docker compose up` they're is a problem, relaunch the command (and do not delete the previous build and images), it will work.
- Go on "http://localhost:8080", at each loading, it will increment a value into the database, the number of all incrementations is printed
